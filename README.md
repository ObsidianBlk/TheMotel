# Cypress Motel

Can you survive till morning?

In this first person horror game made for Scream Jam 2024, you find yourself starting your fist graveyard shift as a maintenance worker at the Cypress Motel at the edge of town, but something is definitely off about this place. 

All you know is you have been told that a note has been left for you just inside the office, located just ahead and to your right of the main drive. It should have your instructions for the night.

You only have to make it to the end of your shift at 6AM. You should be fine right?
